# BMS Digital Signage - Backend Design Summary

This document provides a summary of the backend design for the BMS Digital Signage system and serves as an index to the detailed documentation.

## Documentation Overview

We've created three comprehensive documents to guide the backend design and implementation:

1. **[Backend Design Notes](./backend-design-notes.md)** - High-level architecture, data models, and improvement recommendations
2. **[Backend Implementation Examples](./backend-implementation-examples.md)** - Practical code examples for common operations
3. **[MI TV Backend Optimization](./mi-tv-backend-optimization.md)** - Specific optimizations for MI TV Stick deployment

## Current Architecture

The BMS Digital Signage system uses **Supabase** as its backend platform, providing:

- PostgreSQL database
- Authentication system
- Storage for images
- Row-level security
- Real-time subscriptions

The frontend is a React-based web application that communicates directly with Supabase using the JavaScript client.

## Key Data Models

- **Categories** - Product categories with display order
- **Products** - Individual products with category association
- **Product Prices** - Size/tier-based pricing for products
- **Announcements** - Time-based promotional content
- **Settings** - System configuration

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Backend Enhancements (1-2 weeks)
- Add missing database indexes
- Implement audit logging
- Create store-specific settings
- Optimize image storage and delivery

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (2-3 weeks)
- Develop inventory management
- Implement real-time updates
- Create store management functionality
- Add offline capabilities

### Phase 3: Optimization & Scaling (1-2 weeks)
- Implement caching strategy
- Add performance monitoring
- Optimize for MI TV Stick deployment
- Implement error recovery mechanisms

## MI TV Stick Considerations

The MI TV Stick deployment requires special consideration due to hardware limitations:

- Limited memory (1GB RAM)
- Potential network instability in retail environments
- Browser performance constraints

Key optimizations include:

- Progressive data loading
- Image optimization
- Local caching
- Memory management
- Offline capabilities
- Automatic error recovery

## Next Steps

1. Review the detailed documentation
2. Prioritize implementation tasks
3. Create a development timeline
4. Implement and test core enhancements
5. Deploy to test environment
6. Validate on MI TV Stick hardware
7. Roll out to production

## Technical Decisions

### Authentication
- Email/password authentication via Supabase Auth
- JWT tokens for session management
- Row-level security for authorization

### Data Access
- Direct database access via Supabase API
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates
- Optimistic UI updates with server validation

### Image Management
- Public storage bucket for images
- Optimized image sizes for TV display
- Progressive loading for better performance

### Caching Strategy
- Local storage for offline capability
- Service worker for image caching
- Memory-efficient data structures

### Error Handling
- Exponential backoff for API requests
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- Fallback to cached content when offline

## Conclusion

The backend design provides a solid foundation for the BMS Digital Signage system, with specific optimizations for the MI TV Stick deployment environment. By following the implementation roadmap and applying the recommended optimizations, the system will deliver a reliable and performant digital signage solution for retail environments.
